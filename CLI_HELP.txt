dockerfile_version_bumper 0.2.0
Simple tool for scanning `Dockerfile`s and switching the image tags that appear in `FROM` to their latest version.

Usage: dockerfile_version_bumper [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -f, --dockerfile <DOCKERFILES>  [default: Dockerfile]
  -p, --parent <PARENTS>          Parent images (FROM lines) base names that should be bumped. If empty, bumps every image in the Dockerfile that is found in the registry
      --major                     Allow bumping to new major versions (which might be incompatible), which is interpreted as the leading number in the version
      --dry-run                   Print the output instead of updating in-place (dry run)
      --json                      Print version bumps in json format. Still bumps Dockerfiles unless --dry-run is also given
  -h, --help                      Print help
